<p><b>Australia, officially the Commonwealth of Australia, is a sovereign country comprising the mainland of the Australian continent, the island of Tasmania, and numerous smaller islands.
[16] Australia is the largest country by area in Oceania and the world's sixth-largest country. Australia is the oldest,[17] flattest,[18] and driest inhabited continent,[19][20] with the least fertile soils.
[21][22] It is a megadiverse country, and its size gives it a wide variety of landscapes and climates, with deserts in the centre, tropical rainforests in the north-east, tropical savannas in the north, and mountain ranges in the south-east.
